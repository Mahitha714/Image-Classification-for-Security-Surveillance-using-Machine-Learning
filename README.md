# Image-Classification-for-Security-Surveillance-using-Machine-Learning
A Java-based machine learning project that classifies surveillance images to identify potential security threats using CNN and SVM models, with data preprocessing and performance evaluation using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.


## Description
Image Classification for Security Surveillance is a **Java-based machine learning project** designed to support security monitoring by classifying surveillance images into relevant categories. The project applies **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** models to analyze image data and detect potential security-related events.

The system includes image preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and performance evaluation using standard classification metrics such as **precision, recall, and F1-score**. This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques in real-world **security and surveillance scenarios**.
